# Behaviour

*This is a collection of statements and comments on Glip regarding behaviour plugin questions.*

Nicholas Dionysopoulos
> I think the orthogonal plugins should not be implemented as system plugins. It's a super polluted directory already.
> I propose adding a new plugin category called "behaviour".
> Thus we can have "Behaviour - Taggable".
> Do you agree with the "behaviour" name for the plugin group?
> And the Taggable, Versionable etc names?

Niels Braczek
> No problem for me. Naming seems to be reasonable. 

Nicholas Dionysopoulos
> Awesome! I can FINALLY get to write that code now 

Herman Peeren
> or we use Nooku Framework as a basis and have an advanced implementation of behaviours (called behaviors there) and
> some kind of horizontal components (called reusable components there) and a RESTful interface out of the box and can
> start programming features now instead of basic building blocks.  Of course I'm just kidding, but sometimes I think
> we should seriously discuss it as an option, once. Its original intent was to be a new engine for Joomla 

Robert Deutz
> if someone is going to use nooku as base for joomla I will start learning wordpress

Herman Peeren
> Something else that could be worth looking at for inspiration: Paul Delbar has put many years of work into
> his One|Content extensions. AFAIK they were never on the JED. But it is now available on
> [Github](https://github.com/pdelbar?tab=repositories).
> He is now working on the release of a Joomla 3.x version. The main system is in the system plugin; see for instance
> [pdelbar/one-content-system-plugin](https://github.com/pdelbar/one-content-system-plugin/tree/master/core).
> Descriptions are in subdirectories, like for instance
> [pdelbar/one-content-system-plugin/.../behavior.md](https://github.com/pdelbar/one-content-system-plugin/blob/master/core/behavior/behavior.md).

>I have no time to study it now, but just dump it here to not forget.
