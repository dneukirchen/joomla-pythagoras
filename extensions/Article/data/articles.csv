<p>This project defines the development target for Joomla! That means: The ongoing development of the Joomla CMS will one day
end up to be identical to this code. It follows a clean-base approach.</p>

<h2>Why Clean Base?</h2>

<p>We honestly tried an incremental approach, i.e., to transform J!3 into J!X using small steps.
The tight coupling and non-sufficient test coverage, however, makes it extremely hard to apply a state-of-the-art architecture.</p>

<p>It was suggested to start from a fresh ground, the clean base, to create the basic architecture,
and to port existing functionality in a second step.
The J!X Architecture Team decided to try this approach.</p>

<h2>The ""Chris Davenport Happy Milestone"" (CDHM)</h2>

<p>The team defined a milestone, named after the team member, Chris Davenport, who brought up the requirements.
You can see the original document here: <a href=""https://github.com/joomla-projects/joomla-pythagoras/blob/master/docs/j4cdhms.md"">docs/j4cdhms.md</a></p>

<p>The final decision is made, when the milestone is reached, or it shows out, that it can not be reached with the clean base approach.</p>
